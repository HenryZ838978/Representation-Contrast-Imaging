**Quantifying the structure that practitioners feel but cannot see.**

> Every ML engineer has intuitions about models — *"this one is robust,"* *"that one degrades unpredictably,"* *"alignment makes it safer but less expressive."*  
> These intuitions are real. They reflect the topological structure of the model's representation manifold — a structure that exists in thousands of dimensions, invisible to any single metric.  
> **SNI makes it visible.**

  <em>Same model, before and after alignment. Red = danger zones (repetition collapse). Blue-green = safe operating space.</em>
</p>

Using [Representation Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405) control vectors as **contrast agents**, SNI sweeps a model's 5-dimensional personality space (emotion, formality, creativity, confidence, empathy), measures where output quality degrades, and projects the resulting hidden-state geometry into an interactive 3D point cloud — a **nebula** whose shape, color, and density encode the model's structural health.

**Color** = safety. Blue is stable. Red is cliff territory — the boundary of the model's safe operating envelope.  
**Shape** = architecture strategy. A round nebula means capacity is distributed broadly across personality dimensions. A concentrated streak means capacity is focused into a high-throughput primary corridor — more efficient on-axis, with sharper boundaries off-axis.

## Part I — What This Reveals

### 1. Two Strategies: Distributed vs. Concentrated

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/sni/sni_qwen3_vs_minicpm.png" width="100%" alt="Qwen3-8B (Distributed) vs MiniCPM4.1-8B (Concentrated)">
</p>

|  | **Qwen3-8B** | **MiniCPM4.1-8B** |
|---|---|---|
| Shape | Spherical, multi-dimensional | Concentrated "galaxy band" |
| PCA variance distribution | 58.2 + 20.9 + 8.0% | 83.1 + 10.8 + 3.3% |
| PC1:PC2 ratio | **2.7 : 1** | **7.7 : 1** |
| Strategy | Distributed · Multi-axis | Channel-concentrated · High-density |
| Avg danger | 0.042 | 0.019 (extremely low on-axis) |

**What the nebula tells you**: These two models represent fundamentally different architectural strategies for allocating representation capacity.

**Qwen3-8B** distributes capacity broadly across all personality dimensions — you can steer emotion, formality, creativity independently without interference. The nebula is spherical because the representation space spans multiple axes roughly equally. This gives **robustness**: the model tolerates perturbation in any direction.

**MiniCPM4.1-8B** concentrates 83% of its personality variance into a single dominant principal component — a high-throughput **primary manifold corridor**. Along this corridor, MiniCPM4.1 is remarkably efficient (average danger 0.019, lower than Qwen3's 0.042). The bright, concentrated galaxy band you see is the region where the model operates at peak density. This is consistent with the [Scaling Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06395) / Density Law principle: with limited parameters, maximize information density per parameter by concentrating capacity where it matters most. The trade-off is that **the boundaries of this corridor are sharper** — off-axis perturbations exit the high-density region quickly.

Neither strategy is inherently superior — they sit on different points of the **efficiency-robustness Pareto frontier**. SNI makes this trade-off geometrically visible for the first time.

The side-view angle makes the concentration structure especially clear:

  <em>Side view — Qwen3's distributed sphere vs MiniCPM's concentrated primary corridor.</em>
</p>

### 2. The Alignment Effect: Burning Star → Cool Nebula

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/sni/sni_base_vs_instruct.png" width="100%" alt="Base vs Instruct">
</p>

|  | **Qwen2.5-7B Base** | **Qwen2.5-7B Instruct** |
|---|---|---|
| Color | Fiery red-orange | Cool blue-green |
| Cliffs | **143** | **0** |
| Avg danger | 0.211 | 0.019 |
| Danger reduction | — | **12× lower** |
| PC1:PC2 ratio | 1.5 : 1 | 1.5 : 1 |

**The base model is a burning star.** Nearly the entire representation space is above the safety threshold. There are 143 cliff points — positions where a 0.2-step change in any personality coefficient causes output quality to drop catastrophically (trigram repetition > 8%).

**After SFT + RLHF, it becomes a cool nebula.** Zero cliffs. Average danger drops 12×. The manifold shape (PC ratio) is preserved — alignment doesn't restructure the space, it **smooths the surface**. The red zones haven't disappeared; they've been suppressed below the danger threshold.

The visual analogy is precise: alignment acts as a **cooling process** on the representation manifold. The underlying topology persists, but the extreme states are no longer accessible to normal decoding.

### 3. Chain-of-Thought as Internal Normalization

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/sni/sni_thinking_off_vs_on.png" width="100%" alt="Thinking OFF vs ON">
</p>

|  | **Thinking OFF** | **Thinking ON** |
|---|---|---|
| Cliffs | 4 | **0** |
| Avg danger | 0.042 | **0.000** |
| Color | Blue-green core + yellow-orange halo | Uniform ethereal blue |
| PC1:PC2 | 2.7 : 1 | 2.7 : 1 |

Same model (Qwen3-8B), same control vectors, same coefficients. The only difference: whether `<think>` mode is enabled.

**Thinking ON produces zero cliffs and near-zero danger across the entire manifold.** The CoT reasoning chain acts as an internal normalization mechanism that prevents the model from ever reaching repetition collapse — regardless of how hard you push the personality coefficients.

The nebula transforms from a dense, multi-colored cloud (with localized danger zones) into an almost perfectly uniform blue mist. This is the first visual evidence that CoT reasoning **fundamentally changes the topology of what the model can express**, not just how it formats the output.

## Part II — How It Works

### The Principle: Contrast Imaging for Neural Networks

The method is borrowed from radiology. In CT imaging, a contrast agent (iodine) is injected into the body, then scanned. Structures that were invisible — blood vessels, tumors — light up because the agent accumulates differently in different tissues.

**SNI does the same to LLMs:**

| CT Imaging | Semantic Nebula Imaging |
|---|---|
| Contrast agent (iodine) | RepEng control vector |
| Injection dose (mL) | Coefficient α ∈ [−3.0, +3.0] |
| X-ray scan | Output quality metrics (repetition, cosine similarity, logprob) |
| Tissue boundary | Domain boundary in representation space |
| Tumor lighting up | Repetition cliff / cosine drop |
| Organ structure | Pretrain data topology on the manifold |

### The Mathematics

Representation Engineering modifies hidden states by linear injection:

$$h' = h + \alpha \cdot v$$

where $h$ is the original hidden state, $v$ is a pre-trained control vector for a semantic dimension (e.g., *emotion_valence*), and $\alpha$ is the coefficient.

**If the representation manifold were uniformly smooth, the dose-response curve (α → output quality) would also be smooth.** Discontinuities in the curve reveal discontinuities in the manifold — domain boundaries, attractor basins, and topological features of the pretrain data distribution.

### Why This Is Valid

**Q: You're projecting from 5D to 3D. Don't you lose information?**

PCA captures 70–97% of the variance in 3 components (model-dependent). The remaining variance is small — and the fact that different models produce *visually distinct* nebulae that correctly predict known model properties (MiniCPM4.1's channel concentration, alignment smoothing, CoT immunity) is strong empirical evidence that the projection preserves the diagnostically relevant structure.

**Q: The danger colors come from a fitted model, not direct measurement.**

For models with terrain data (dose-response sweeps), the quadratic manifold model is fitted to hundreds of actual output measurements. The model's $R²$ is typically > 0.85. For the points between measured sweep positions, the smooth interpolation is a conservative estimate — real cliffs are sharper than the model predicts.

**Q: Are the structural differences real, or artifacts of PCA?**

The PC1:PC2 ratio is PCA-independent in the sense that it measures actual variance concentration, not an artifact of the projection method. MiniCPM4.1's 7.7:1 ratio means that 83% of the control vector response is genuinely concentrated along one axis in the full-dimensional hidden state space — a high-density design consistent with its parameter-efficient architecture. The 3D rendering makes this structural choice visible, it doesn't create it.

### Validated Across 14 Models

The cross-model study covers the full spectrum of conditions:

| Variable | Models Tested | Key Finding |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Qwen3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-14B, MiniCPM4.1-8B | Distinct concentration strategies visible |
| Alignment | Base vs Instruct | 12× danger reduction, 0 cliffs |
| Reasoning | Thinking OFF vs ON | Complete cliff immunity |
| Quantization | BF16 vs AWQ-Int4 | Nearly identical topology |
| Scale | 8B vs 14B | Slightly smoother at larger scale |
| Language | Chinese / English / Mixed | English amplifies cliffs 3.7× |
| Temperature | 0.1 / 0.6 / 1.0 / 1.5 | Cliff position stable, shape changes |

Total: **13 experiments, 6,045 generations, 92 cliffs detected.**

## Part III — What It's For

### Model Comparison at a Glance

Instead of running benchmarks that compress a model's behavior into a single number, SNI gives you a **holistic structural portrait**. Two models with identical perplexity scores can have radically different nebula shapes — one distributed (broad robustness), one concentrated (high-density corridor). The nebula reveals architectural strategy choices that benchmarks cannot capture.

### Training Stage Diagnostics

By imaging the same model at different training checkpoints (pretrain → SFT → RLHF), you can **watch the manifold cool down** in real time. This provides a new quality signal for alignment teams: is your RLHF actually smoothing the dangerous regions, or just masking them?

### Safety Envelope Visualization

The terrain data underlying each nebula defines a **per-dimension safe operating range** — the region where personality steering doesn't trigger output collapse. This is more informative than a single L2-norm safety radius, because the safe envelope is asymmetric and dimension-dependent:

```
                    SAFE RANGE (Qwen3-8B)
                    ────────────────────────────────
emotion_valence     [−3.0 ████████████████████▓░░░░░░░ +1.8]
formality           [−3.0 ████████████████████████████████ +3.0]
creativity          [−1.0 ███████████████████████████████ +3.0]
confidence          [−3.0 ████████████████████████████████ +3.0]
empathy             [−0.4 ████ +0.0]  ← narrowest
```

### Navigation on the Manifold (Next Step)

The terrain map defines where cliffs are. The next step is **using it for real-time adaptive steering** — finding optimal paths between personality states that stay within the safe envelope, avoid cliffs, and maximize expressiveness.

We have a working `ManifoldPathPlanner` that computes geodesic-like paths with boundary repulsion on the 5D manifold. The zero-hysteresis property (confirmed experimentally: all paths are reversible) simplifies this to pure geometry.

**The vision**: instead of manually tuning RepEng coefficients and hoping you don't hit a cliff, the navigator plans a smooth trajectory from state A to state B — like GPS routing on a mountain road, staying on the safe ridges and avoiding the drops.

## Relation to Representation Contrast Imaging

This repository evolves from our earlier work on **Representation Contrast Imaging (表征显影)** — 1D/2D dose-response terrain mapping that first revealed topological discontinuities in LLM hidden states.

SNI builds on that foundation by projecting the full 5D personality manifold into 3D, replacing terrain-map line charts with holistic point-cloud visualization. The underlying data and methodology are the same; the imaging modality is new.

**Terrain mapping** = measuring individual cross-sections of the manifold (like 1D slices through a CT scan).  
**Semantic Nebula Imaging** = reconstructing the full 3D volume from those cross-sections (like a full 3D CT reconstruction).
